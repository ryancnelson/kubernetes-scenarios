So, now you should have some:
`---CERTIFICATE STUFF---```  ready to copy and paste.

That's your "trust bundle".


NOW: 
*copy the `---CERTIFICATE STUFF---` above * 
... then go to http://console.demo.scytale.io/v2 , and ask the instructors for your login credentials.

once you're logged in, click the <img src="http://nelson.dev/authenticate-button.jpg"> button, and paste in your trust-bundle.

Enter a descriptive name, and submit.
